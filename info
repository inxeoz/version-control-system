Creating a full version control system (VCS) in Rust, especially one based on hashing differences, is a substantial undertaking, but I can guide you through it step by step. We’ll break it down into parts for easier development.

Here’s a breakdown of how we can approach it:
1. Initialization (Create a Repository)

This will be the entry point where a user can initialize a new VCS repository for tracking their files.

    Directory structure: Create a .vcs directory to store the repository information.
    Metadata storage: Create a file (e.g., config) inside .vcs to store repository settings and metadata (e.g., the root directory, initial commit).

2. Hashing & Storing Files (Track Files)

We'll need to compute a hash for each file to track changes. This can be done using cryptographic hash functions like SHA256.

    File Hashing: Generate a hash of the contents of files and store them in a separate database (e.g., objects directory).
    Storing Files: Store file data in a structured format, such as in a series of objects or commits.

3. Creating Commits (Versioning Changes)

A commit will represent a snapshot of the repository at a given time, storing hashes of the files that are being tracked.

    Commit Objects: Each commit will contain a timestamp, commit hash, file hashes, and metadata like the commit message and author.
    Linking Commits: Each commit should link to the previous commit, creating a chain of commits (like a git history).

4. Tracking Changes (Diffs)

To identify changes in files between commits, we’ll need to track the difference in content.

    Change Detection: Compute the difference between the content of files across commits.
    Storing Diffs: Store the diffs, possibly by hashing the differences and storing them efficiently in the database.

5. Pushing and Pulling (Remote Repositories)

While this version control system could initially work locally, it could be expanded to allow pushing and pulling to remote repositories.

    Remote Storage: Define methods to interact with remote repositories (push, pull).
    Network Communication: For interacting with remotes, you’ll need a protocol to handle file transfer (could be HTTP-based, for instance).

6. Branching (Concurrent Development)

Implement branching, so users can create separate lines of development and merge them later.

    Branch Objects: Create Branch objects that can point to specific commits.
    Merging: Implement basic merging algorithms to combine changes from different branches.

7. Undoing Changes (Reverting and Resetting)

Implement commands to revert changes (e.g., revert to a previous commit).

    Revert Commits: Allow a user to revert a commit or reset the repository to a specific state.

8. CLI Interface (User Interaction)

Implement a CLI tool for users to interact with the version control system. This will include commands such as:

    init - Initialize a new repository.
    add - Add a file to be tracked.
    commit - Commit changes to the repository.
    status - Show the current state of the repository.
    log - Show commit history.
    push - Push changes to a remote.
    pull - Pull changes from a remote.
    Branch - Create, list, and manage branches.
    merge - Merge branches.
